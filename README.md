## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [Implemented] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [Implemented] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [Implemented] User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart
